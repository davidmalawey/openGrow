## Welcome
_opengrow is an open source engineering project for modern small-scale farming.  If you love gardening and technology, you'll find designs here to support your DIY projects for aquaponics & hydroponics, and automated garden systems. The difference between this project and many others is that it's supported by real engineers with knowledge of mechanical systems, fluids, electronics, & software._

This webpage will be made to describe the free designs available for the system shown in the following video:

## Designs
* Find 3D Models for the designs featured in the video above, on grabCAD

Here's a snapshot of the self-contained circulating aquaponics system.  By omitting the aquarium, this can be simplified into a hydroponics system.
